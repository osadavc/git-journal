                Dear Diary, <br />
                Today, I confidently walked into a glass door, thinking it was
                open. My attempt to play it cool failed miserably as everyone
                burst into laughter. I'll never live this down. Note to self:
                Practice your superhero vision skills or get a neon sign that
                says, "This is a door!"

                Dear Diary, <br />
                Guess what happened during my presentation? I accidentally
                called my boss "mom" in front of the entire team. The room fell
                silent, and my cheeks turned crimson. I tried to recover, but
                let's just say, "Oops! Freudian slip!" Now, every meeting is
                filled with suspicious parental glances.

                Today, I thought I was being super sneaky and discreetly
                adjusted my underwear in public. Little did I know, I was on a
                live video conference! My colleague's horrified expressions gave
                it away. Now, my nickname at the office is "Captain Underpants."
                Time to start a new job in disguise.
